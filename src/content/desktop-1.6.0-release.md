We are happy to announce that Cryptomator 1.6.0 has been released! :tada: If you are not already up-to-date about its features, we published a [heads-up article](https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/1-6-0-what-you-need-to-know/) about it last week. It summarizes the most important changes and we also wrote an [in-depth article](https://cryptomator.org/blog/2021/10/11/vault-format-8/) about the new vault format shipped with version 1.6.0.

Besides the updated vault format, we integrated a "Vault Health Check" tool, which can detect and fix structural problems of a vault. It is not a magical fix-all-tool but it can be very useful to detect common problems. We also added new features like auto lock and a plugin API so that Cryptomator is now able to load plugins from a dedicated plugin directory.
