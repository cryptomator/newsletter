Hello there,

Besides the constant development of Cryptomator, we have been working on some articles to bring Cryptomator a little closer to you and everyone who's interested. It's all about open source, encryption via Dropbox, and a comparison of Cryptomator and Boxcryptor.

If you haven't read the articles yet, we have linked them here for you.

- <https://cryptomator.org/boxcryptor-alternative/>

We also added several new ways to claim your supporter certificate. This allows us to show our gratitude for non-monetary contributions such as blog posts, how-to videos, wiki contributions, etc.

## How Open Source Strengthens Security

<a href="https://cryptomator.org/open-source/">

</a>

To help you understand what open source actually means, let's start with an example.

Imagine you are in a foreign city. In the evening, you visit a part of town that is considered a bit shady. There, you go to a bar and want to have a drink.

Which of the following scenarios sounds safer to you:
1. The bartender prepares your drink right in front of you.
2. A stranger offers you some of his drink.

You probably already sense a tendency: The stranger may look nice – and in most cases there is certainly no reason for suspicion.

But you don't know: What if there is something in the drink that shouldn't be there?

And maybe the old saying comes to your mind: Trust, but verify.

## Encrypt Your Dropbox

<a href="https://cryptomator.org/encrypt-dropbox/">

</a>

Cryptomator puts the data in your Dropbox into a "magic" vault. Magical because the entire vault and its contents only appear with the right password – and only to the person with the right password.

When the door to the vault is closed again, the entire vault and its valuable contents disappear again until the next time you open it with the right password.

This means that attackers would not even benefit from drilling through the wall of the vault. Because the vault is empty if the correct password is missing. (For Marvel fans: It works similarly to the portal in Doctor Strange).

</a>

You want your sensitive data to be secure in the cloud. But so far, no encryption solution has been able to convince you?

Maybe you are looking for a free alternative to Boxcryptor, maybe you are missing relevant features in Boxcryptor, or maybe independence and freedom through free software is important to you.

Whatever it is – you will find answers to your questions here.

In this article, we introduce you to Cryptomator, an alternative to Boxcryptor, and explain the similarities and differences.
