## Cryptomator Hub

In other news, you may remember our teaser of Cryptomator Hub from the end of last year. It's a separate but fully compatible product to Cryptomator that will add zero-knowledge key management for teams. And we're now approaching a closed beta release. :tada:

If you're interested in this product and would like to test it on your Kubernetes cluster, please subscribe to our Hub mailing list on our [landing page](https://cryptomator.org/hub/). We'll send out invitations very soon! :robot:
