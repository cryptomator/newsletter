Cryptomator Hub is almost ready for a closed beta. If you're interested, please join us! :tada:

At first, Cryptomator Hub will be a self-hosted solution. Ideally, you are already familiar with Kubernetes (and/or Docker Compose) and can get started right away.

Send us an email to [hub-beta@cryptomator.org](mailto:hub-beta@cryptomator.org?subject=Requesting%20Cryptomator%20Hub%20Invitation) if you'd like to join the closed beta. Let us know if you're ready for a test deployment.
