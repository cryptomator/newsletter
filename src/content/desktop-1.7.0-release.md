We are happy to announce that Cryptomator 1.7.0 has been released! :tada: If you are not already up-to-date about its features, we published a [heads-up article](https://cryptomator.org/blog/2023/02/01/1-7-0-what-you-need-to-know/) about it last month, which highlights the most important changes.

With "Locate Encrypted File", you can now reveal the encrypted counterpart of any file in the vault, which is useful (or even essential) for restoring old versions of a file. For all the macOS users with Apple Silicon Macs out there, you can now use FUSE-T to unlock/mount your vaults. And check out the other changes in the blog post.
