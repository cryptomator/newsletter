## Upgrade Info

For self-hosted instances: If you are on the `stable` lane, you just have to pull the image and restart the service. Otherwise, update the version number in your Docker Compose or Kubernetes spec file before you restart the service. Remember to always [back up your data](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/hub/setup/#backup), especially before upgrading.

For managed instances: Rest assured, you're already on the latest version.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
